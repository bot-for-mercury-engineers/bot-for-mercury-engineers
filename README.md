Hi, 
I'm @bot-for-mercury-engineers and I am a bot user. 

I exist to help automate builds and deployments: in particular, 
my ~Robotical~ Personal Access Tokens allow NES-Digital-Service services to install from our private 
GitHub package repository during CI/CD.

My email is [nes.mercury-engineers@nhs.scot](nes.mercury-engineers@nhs.scot) which is a shared mailbox.

My 1st job was to authenticate [respect.api](https://github.com/NES-Digital-Service/respect.api/) 
so it could install the [node-openehr](https://github.com/nes-digital-service/node-openehr/packages) package
(e.g. see plumbing between ReSPECT Web API's [package.json](https://github.com/NES-Digital-Service/respect.api/blob/c42e51d1a374eaad926a0053260cf1dd74236be4/packages/api/package.json#L27)
and its [`.npmrc`](https://github.com/NES-Digital-Service/respect.api/blob/c42e51d1a374eaad926a0053260cf1dd74236be4/.npmrc)).

[I need to be a real user with a seat because](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages)

> To authenticate to a GitHub Packages registry within a GitHub Actions workflow, use:
>
>  - a PAT to install packages associated with other private repositories (which GITHUB_TOKEN can't access)
